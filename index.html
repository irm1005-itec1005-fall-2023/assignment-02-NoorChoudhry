    <h1>Follow Noor as She Pursues Life</h1>

  <h2> About me (Noor): </h2>
  <h3>Let me Introduce Myself</h3>
    <p>Hey, my name is Noor Choudhry. I was born and raised in Ottawa, specifically in Orleans, and have been here my whole life. Growing up in Ottawa was truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Despite the limited entertainment options within the city, I found myself embracing the abundance of nature trails that spread throughout. I love everything from sci-fi/action movies, visual arts, sports, etc.! This allowed me to embark on a journey of self-discovery and create my own exhilarating adventures and random side quests that I will expand on if you keep reading!</p>
      
  <h3>Life in Sport</h3>
    <p>One thing I was so lucky to have growing up was athletic opportunities to pursue many different sports. From elementary to high school, every year (except for covid) I've joined sports. Over the years I’ve played: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basketball (x3 gold medal)</li>
        <li>Volleyball (x1 gold medal)</li>
        <li>Badminton (recreational)</li>
        <li>Soccer</li>
        <li>Cross-country skiing (recreational)</li>
        <li>Rugby (x1 gold medal + competed at OFSAA )</li>
      </ul>
        <p>...at a scholastic and recreational level. I developed teamwork and communication skills. Made new friends and built strong relationships. Boosted confidence and self-esteem I’d say is a direct result, especially when it's a strong, gold-medal, season. On and off the game, you could find me score-keeping or running lines for other teams in my school. Sport is a community that, in my opinion, keeps you physically and mentally healthy.</p>

  <h3>Community</h3>
    <p>A big part of my life has been serving the community. Getting involved with extracurricular activities inside and outside of school keeps me busy. Volunteering at schools, charities, and my local mosque plays a large role in my life. I joined a leadership program at my school which gave me the opportunity to actively practice leadership roles. I've been given the opportunity to hone my leadership skills and advocate for the community. Being part of such groups opens the door to life experiences and opportunities to do all sorts of things!</p>
